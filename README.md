"Car_Owner" is my first ever project using RESTful API on C#.

It has a simple Owner-Car relationship with a username/password behavior.

The requests are made through an API client (Insomnia), processed by the server, which afterward stores the data into a SQL Server database implementing LINQ to Entities.
